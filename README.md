### Frontend Developer | Software Engineer  

I build things for the web with a focus on clean design, solid architecture, and smooth user experiences.  
Most of my work sits at the intersection of **frontend engineering** and **UI/UX thinking** — turning ideas into interfaces people actually want to use.
